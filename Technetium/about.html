    This site is created with the purest form of JavaScript and no external libraries has been used.
    A little bit of CSS has been used to style the basic of components. The pages are loaded dynamically using
    <code>fetch</code> JavaScript API, and displayed on the same page. Although there is a short coming that
    you cannot push to the local history stack due to obvious security reasons while accessing a file through
    the protocol. Thus, I have been unable to produce dynamic links to pages, and hence the URI of the window
    instance is not observant of the change made to the page.
